## v5.0.0
### Breaking Changes
- **Discore now targets .NET 6.0.**
- Discord entities (such as `DiscordMessage`) no longer keep a reference to a `DiscordHttpClient` internally and therefore no longer have methods for modifying the entity.
    - All removed methods were just shortcuts for `DiscordHttpClient` calls and can be migrated by just using a `DiscordHttpClient` instead (ex. `DiscordMessage.Edit()` -> `DiscordHttpClient.EditMessage(DiscordMessage)`).
- Caching breaking changes:
    - `DiscordShardCache` has been replaced with the new `Discore.Caching.DiscordMemoryCache`.
    - `Shard.Cache` was removed in favor of making caching optional for Gateway connections. To get built-in caching behavior back, instantiate the new `DiscordMemoryCache` with your `Shard`. The new `DiscordMemoryCache` object has a nearly identical interface to the old `DiscordShardCache`.
    - DM channels are no longer cached since the Gateway no longer sends 'Channel Create' events for DMs as of v8.
- `IDiscordGateway` breaking changes:
    - Events have been renamed to be more consistent. All new event names follow the pattern `OnEventName` (e.g. `OnMessageCreated` was renamed to `OnMessageCreate`).
    - Events now emit unique event args per event instead of some events sharing arg types (arg class names now follow the pattern `EventNameEventArgs`).
    - `OnMessageUpdated` now emits a `DiscordPartialMessage` instead of a normal `DiscordMessage`.
    - `OnGuildAvailable` and `OnGuildUnavailable` were merged into `OnGuildCreate` and `OnGuildDelete`. To see whether the guild availability status changed, use the new `BecameAvailable` and `Unavailable` properties in the event args.
    - `OnDMChannel*` events were removed (bots no longer receive events for DM channels as of Gateway v8).
    - `OnChannel*` events now emit a `DiscordChannel` instead of a `DiscordGuildChannel` (matches the actual Gateway spec).
    - `UpdateStatusAsync` was renamed to `UpdatePresenceAsync`.
- Voice breaking changes:
    - Voice connections are now decoupled from `Shard` instances.
    - Removed `DiscordVoiceConnection.Shard`.
    - Removed `ShardVoiceManager` (use the new `DiscordVoiceConnection` constructors instead).
    - Removed `VoiceConnectionEventArgs.Shard`.
    - Removed `VoiceConnectionInvalidationReason.BotRemovedFromGuild` (this case is now just a normal invalidation).
    - Removed `Shard.Voice`.
- `Shard.StartAsync` now requires either a `GatewayIntent` or `ShardStartConfig` argument.
- Renamed `DiscordGame` to `DiscordActivity` (to match Gateway v8 changes).
- Renamed `DiscordGameType` to `DiscordActivityType` (to match Gateway v8 changes).
- Removed `DiscordUserPresence.Game` (use `Activities.FirstOrDefault()` instead).
- Renamed `StatusOptions` to `PresenceOptions`.
    - `PresenceOptions` now takes a list of activities instead of a single `Game`.
- Renamed `GameOptions` to `ActivityOptions`.
- `DiscordVoiceConnection.SetSpeakingAsync` will now throw an `InvalidOperationException` if called before being fully connected.
- `DiscordVoiceConnection.ClearVoiceBuffer` will now throw an `InvalidOperationException` if called before being fully connected.
- `DiscordVoiceConnection.ConnectAsync` no longer checks if the application is allowed to join the voice channel. If the application is not allowed to join the connection will still fail, but it will be attempted.
    - To get this functionality back, please use the new `DiscordPermissionHelper.CanJoinVoiceChannel` helper function.
- `DiscordHttpRateLimitException.Limit` is now nullable.
- `DiscordHttpRateLimitException.Reset` is now nullable.
- `DiscordHttpRateLimitException.ResetHighPrecision` is now nullable.
- `ShardStartConfig.GatewayLargeThreshold` now defaults to the Gateway's default of 50 (down from 250).
- `DiscordHttpErrorCode.TooManyReactions` renamed to `MaximumReactionsReached`.
- `DiscordHttpRateLimitException.RetryAfter` is now a `double` and includes millisecond precision.
- Guild embeds are replaced with guild widgets (API v8 change):
    - Removed `DiscordGuild.IsEmbedEnabled` and `EmbedChannelId` (use `IsWidgetEnabled` and `WidgetChannelId` instead).
    - Renamed `DiscordGuildEmbed` to `DiscordGuildWidgetSettings`.
    - Renamed `DiscordHttpErrorCode.EmbedDisabled` to `WidgetDisabled`.
    - Renamed `ModifyGuildEmbedOptions` to `ModifyGuildWidgetOptions`.
    - Renamed `DiscordHttpClient.GetGuildEmbed` to `GetGuildWidget`.
    - Renamed `DiscordHttpClient.ModifyGuildEmbed` to `ModifyGuildWidget`.
- Removed deprecated `ShardFailureReason.IOError`
- `DiscordHttpClient.BeginGuildPrune` now returns null if `computePruneCount` is true.
- Renamed `Create/EditMessageOptions.Embed` to `Embeds` to support multiple embeds permessage.
- `DiscordHttpClient.Create/EditMessage` file attachment overloads have been removed. Instead, please use the new `Attachments` property of `Create/EditMessageOptions`.
- Removed `DiscordHttpClient.UseSingleHttpClient` (it's no longer needed).
- Removed deprecated `DiscordHttpClient.GetUserDMs`.
- `Shard.OnReconnected` is now fired at the end of reconnection (as probably expected), rather than the start. This is still guaranteed to be fired before `OnReady`.
- `Create/ModifyGuildOptions.VerificationLevel` is now type `GuildVerificationLevel`.
- `Create/ModifyGuildOptions.DefaultMessageNotifications` is now type `GuildNotificationOption`.
- Removed deprecated/removed `DiscordVoiceRegion` properties (`SampleHostname`, `SamplePort`, `IsVIPOnly`).
- `DiscordEmbed.Color` is now type `DiscordColor`.
- Renamed `DiscordUser.HasTwoFactorAuth` to `MfaEnabled`.
- `DiscordIntegration.ExpireBehavior` is type `IntegrationExpireBehavior`.
- `DiscordInvite` changes:
    - Renamed `TargetUserType` to `TargetType`.
    - `Channel` is now nullable.
    - `Inviter` is now a property of `DiscordInvite` instead of `DiscordInviteMetadata` (should only break reflection).
- Removed `DiscordInviteMetadata.IsRevoked`.
- Renamed `DiscordInviteChannel.ChannelId` to `Id`.
- Renamed `DiscordInviteGuild.GuildId` to `Id`.
- Renamed `DiscordInviteTargetUserType` to `DiscordInviteTargetType`.
- Removed `ShardVoiceManager.GetUsersInVoiceChannel` (please use `DiscordMemoryCache.GetUsersInVoiceChannel` instead).
- Removed `DiscordGuild.RegionId` (deprecated).

- Added `IDiscordGateway.OnVoiceServerUpdate` event.
- Added `IDiscordGateway.UpdateVoiceStateAsync`.

### Changes
- Discore now fully annotates [nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types)!
- Discore now supports Discord API/Gateway v10.
