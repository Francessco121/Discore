# Voice Prerequisites

In order to send/receive voice data through Discore, two external libraries are needed: [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) and [opus](http://opus-codec.org/).

Discore expects the libsodium and opus binaries to be named `libsodium` and `opus` respectively with the OS specific extension and/or prefix. For example, on Windows the binaries would need to be named `libsodium.dll` and `opus.dll`.

## Pre-Compiled Windows Binaries
If your application is targeting Windows, the Discore repository contains tested pre-compiled 32 and 64-bit binaries [which can be downloaded here](https://github.com/Francessco121/Discore/tree/v4/lib/windows).

## Using the Discore Voice API
Once everything is all setup, please see [the documentation on how to use the voice API here](./Connecting-to-a-Voice-Channel).
